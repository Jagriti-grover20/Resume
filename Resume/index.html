        <small>Dedicated Software Engineer and Aspiring Computer Scientist</small>
        <br>  <br>
        <p>I'm a Computer Engineering diploma holder currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Engineering. With a Diploma in Computer Engineering and an ongoing pursuit of a degree in Computer Science & Engineering, I possess a distinguished academic record. The skill set include a proficiency in programming languages such as C and C++, and an understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. Furthermore, I have gained extensive knowledge of Computer Networking and languages such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am also passionate about reading and writing poetry, quotes, and literature, and I further honed my leadership skills as a Class Representative for five years. As a firm advocate of continued learning, I devote my attention to attending workshops, webinars, and reading novels in order to grow both personally and professionally. I firmly believe in constantly expanding my knowledge and skills and never losing momentum, similar to a teacup that is always being filled for the next chapter in life.</p>
